          <p>You can read this or you can't but to be honest I don't even care right now. What is this shit he's telling me about you going through periods where you feel no one likes you? How'd you think I feel ever since you joined OWL you have basically flung me to the side I've been left along you've gotten closer to them than you have ever gotten close with me, me and you used to do everything together and now I'm basically stuck left at the side with nothing, I fucking hate knowing I've never got anyone to play with or rp with, feeling left out all the time, it's fucking shit. Just like all them they aren't even real friends half them only want to be your friends when you got shit, they are simply fucking using you and to be honest I'm pretty sure you know they are but you just ain't doing anything about it, I feel bad for you but clearly you don't feel bad at all but I'm not even going to jog on about them I hate them all, they only wanted to talk with me when they wanted something rped or a paintjob made etc, just like Kazang but meh I'm done with them all and soon with everyone and everything.</p>
